Once the Dreki is stunned, we recommend rushing the creature and unleashing as much heavy damage as possible before the stun effect runs out. This includes using your Runic Attack. Using the Runic Attack early in a fight is generally recommended so you can get the cooldown timer going as soon as possible.\n",

      "3. **Keep moving**: Don't stay in one spot for too long, as Dreki's fire breath can be devastating. Keep moving and use your agility to dodge his attacks.\n",
      "4. **Use your abilities wisely**: As a Dragonborn, you have access to various shouts and abilities that can help you take down Dreki. Use your elemental attacks (e.g., ice or fire) to chip away at his health, and consider using your shout abilities to stun or disorient him.\n",
      "5. **Focus on his weak spots**: Dreki has a few weak points that you can target:\n",
      "\t* His wings: If you can manage to hit his wings, you'll temporarily disable his flight capabilities.\n",
      "\t* His neck: A well-placed attack on his neck can deal significant damage and potentially knock him out of the air.\n",
      "6. **Use potions and poisons**: Consider using potions or poisons that provide fire resistance or increase your damage output against dragons.\n",
      "7. **Stay patient and persistent**: Defeating Dreki will likely take some time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't succeed at first – keep trying, and you'll eventually emerge victorious.\n",
      "\n",

      "1. **Initial Attack**: As soon as the fight starts, be prepared for Dreki's initial saliva attack. You can either dodge it or block it with your shield (or parry it back into the creature if you're using the Dauntless Shield). If you choose to block or parry, take advantage of the brief stun effect to deal some damage.\n",

While it's technically possible to block every attack, keep in mind that this might make dealing damage more challenging. Instead, focus on taking advantage of the brief moments when Dreki is stunned or vulnerable to deal significant damage.\n",
