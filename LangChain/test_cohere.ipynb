      "In addition, they’ll climb high up onto the rock formations, where you’ll only be able to attack them by throwing your Axe to drop them to the ground – thankfully, when they fall, they’ll be temporarily stunned, creating an opportunity to unleash heavy damage. It’s imperative to your success that you continually move about the area when fighting these creatures.\n",
      "Not only will they toss damage-inducing projectiles toward your direction, but they’ll also leave poisonous pools on the ground that will slowly deplete your health when standing on them. If you’re quick enough, you’ll be able to parry this attack and send the projectiles hurling back into them if you’re using the Dauntless Shield.\n",

First, look to the right of the Nornir Chest to find a spinner obscured by a geyser. You can throw the Axe at the geyser to reveal the rune on the spinner: hit it once on the left paddle (or twice on the right paddle) to spin it to the D Rune. From there, head left to the wooden platform to find another spinner on your left: hit it once on the right-hand paddle to spin it to the B Rune. Return to the boat and this time leap up the wooden ledge nearby. Look up on your right to find the spinner: hit it once on the right-hand huddle to spin it to the N Rune.\n",

      "Once frozen, quickly recall your Axe and look for the gap in the side of the wooden structure to break the latch that’s holding the weight – you’ll need to react quickly to succeed in hitting the latch, so it may take a few tries before you’re successful.\n",

It’s imperative to your success that you continually move about the area when fighting these creatures. Not only will they toss damage-inducing projectiles toward your direction, but they’ll also leave poisonous pools on the ground that will slowly deplete your health when standing on them. If you’re quick enough, you’ll be able to parry this attack and send the projectiles hurling back into them when using the Dauntless Shield.\n",
      "Throughout this encounter with the Grims, we highly recommend utilizing the environment to your advantage, as you’ll be able to block incoming projectiles by positioning yourself behind structures.\n",
      "Furthermore, you’ll discover large red-colored vases around the area that will explode when destroyed – we recommend using your Axe from afar to avoid taking unnecessary damage. If you’re able to lure Grims nearby to these vases, you’ll deal significant damage to them.\n",
      "You can also prevent the Cursed Grims from climbing up high by having Atreus destroy the mining cranes that are scattered around the area.\n",
      "Lastly, we also recommend that you work with Atreus throughout this encounter, constantly commanding him to fire upon enemies you’re targeting, as it’ll temporarily stun them, leaving small windows of opportunity to unleash close-range attacks with little risk of receiving damage.\n",

      "Once the area is cleared of Grims, be sure to loot any Healthstones and Beast Scraps that may have dropped, before continuing. You will also find a Red Coffin just left of the large gate that leads towards the mountain,  which will contain +2 Rawhide and some Hacksilver inside, along with a dedicated Hacksilver chest that’s located in the northwest corner of the area – Atreus will need to clear the Soundstones blocking access to the area before you can jump over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ready to continue, open the large gate and continue following the path until you come by a train that can take you up the mountain. Before going up the mountain, head directly west to find a Red Coffin behind a geyser hole and some barrels – this will contain +2 Forged Iron and some Hacksilver. Next, head north, and where you will discover a Hacksilver pouch beside a dead Grim. Unfortunately, you’ll spot a Mystic Gateway on a nearby ledge, however, you won’t be able to access this until you have unlocked the required equipment.\n",

      "Defeat Dreki\n",
      "While inspecting the Dreki, a larger Dreki will appear and charge toward both Atreus and Kratos. The large crocodile-like creature will consist of five sectioned health bars, so you’ll need to deal quite a bit of damage to defeat the monster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Straight out of the gate, the Dreki will spit a ball of saliva toward you – you’ll be dealt damage if you do not move in time. And while it’s arguably easier to just dodge this attack, it’s also possible to block it with your shield, or even parry it back into the creature if you’re using the Dauntless Shield, dealing damage and temporarily stunning it.\n",
      "Keep in mind, though, to parry the attack, you will need to be very precise with your timing, as it’ll only work if you block the attack just before it hits you. Once the Dreki is stunned, we recommend rushing the creature and unleashing as much heavy damage as possible before the stun effect runs out. This includes using your Runic Attack. Using the Runic Attack early in a fight is generally recommended so you can get the cooldown timer going as soon as possible.\n",
      "Fortunately, the Dreki does not have any unblockable attacks until it reaches half health, so technically speaking, every attack the Dreki throws your way can be blocked; however, this isn’t necessarily very efficient as it makes it quite a bit more challenging to deal damage.\n",
      "Need some health? Try looking beside the crates that are found along the outskirts of the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with spitting saliva, the Dreki will also perform two major melee attacks that deal significant damage should you not block them. The first melee attack will see the Dreki jumping toward you, and landing several meters in front of you. The Dreki will then quickly turn and swipe its large tail in your direction - you can either block this attack with your shield or simply dodge out of the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next melee attack is nearly identical to start with, as the creature will leap toward you; however, this time, landing much closer, before performing a yellow (block break) attack in the form of a chomp. If you fail to dodge the attack, the Dreki will grab ahold of you, before slamming you to the ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it didn’t occur every time, we found that more often than not, blocking the Dreki’s chomp attack would trigger a yellow (block break) combination attack that would see the Dreki getting knocked back for a brief moment, only to quickly spit a ball of salvia toward you – you’ll need to act fast to avoid being dealt damage from this attack.

      "\n",
      "As you start to deplete the Dreki’s health (approximately two bars), it’ll introduce a slightly new attack into its arsenal that sees the creature leaping from afar, straight into a chomp attack. This attack is indicated by a yellow circle that will appear before it launches the attack.\n",
      "Don’t be afraid to use your Resurrection Stone if you have one. There’s no checkpoint throughout this fight, so if you happen to die again before the fight is over, you’ll respawn with your stone.\n",
      "Once the Dreki reaches half health, it’ll introduce another new attack to the battle, where it’ll launch an unlockable (red) attack that sees it rearing up into the air, as it begins to charge an electrical AoE attack. If you’re within the electrical circle after it finishes charging, you’ll be dealt damage and temporarily stunned, unable to move or block incoming attacks.\n",
      "Higher Difficulty Tip : While the Dreki is charging up its electric attack, use that brief moment as a chance to charge either the Leviathan Axe or the Blades of Chaos to do extra, more impactful damage.\n",
      "If you happen to escape the attack, just be sure you stay clear of the electrified spots on the ground; otherwise, you’ll also succumb to being electrified – you’ll need to mash circle to escape the hold of the electricity.\n",
      "\n",
      "In turn, the Dreki’s saliva attack will be upgraded into an unblockable attack as it’ll now become electrified, leaving a nasty trail of electricity in its wake.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to these unblockable attacks, we found it was best to keep a distance during the second phase of the fight, as it was much easier to get caught off guard by the electricity attacks. Instead, we only approached within melee distance while the Dreki was temporarily stunned or knocked back, and only unleashing a few heavy melee attacks before retreating to a safe distance.\n",

Once you’re on top of the stone block, throw the Leviathan Axe into the end of the trough: this blocks the water flow, making the crane move you to its original starting position. When the stone block has finally stopped moving, you can have Kratos hang off the side of the stone black and then leap over to a new area. From there, follow the mine cart tracks uphill: the Legendary Chest will be at the top on your right, not too far from the purple glowing artifact nearby.

      "While Atreus takes out the attacking Wretches, you’ll have a moment to start depleting her four-sectioned health bar by unleashing several Axe throws at her from a distance. You should be able to clear at least half of her initial health bar section before she starts moving toward your location. While it’s not much, any extra damage will always be a huge help, especially when playing on harder difficulty levels.\n",

      "Do keep in mind, as you’re getting in close to deal melee damage, just be wary of her unblockable slam attack, which will create a small AoE shockwave. This attack is fairly easy to avoid, as long as you’re backing up as soon as you see the large red rings appear.\n",

This short break will give you a rather risk-free chance to unleash heavy attacks upon the boss without the worry of taking damage – just be ready to back up quickly in case she performs her melee slam.\n",
      "Lastly, Bergsra will perform an attack that sees her lowering to the ground on all fours and spawning several Wretches.

      "Once Bjorn returns to the ground, sprint over and unleash a flurry of heavy and light attacks, as there’s a small window of opportunity where the risk of being hit is very low, as the bear will attempt to regain its footing before launching another attack.\n",
      "After you’ve performed a handful of attacks, back up quickly to avoid taking damage from potential swipes, which have a relatively large radius. However, if you stay close for too long, the bear will bite into you and toss you backward after mashing Circle to escape.\n",
      "It is also worth noting that, like other enemies, Bjorn’s attacks can be canceled with a well-timed Axe throw or melee attack. Furthermore, if you’re starting to run low on health, have Kratos break through the small trees that litter the area in hopes of receiving some Healthstones.\n",

      "With six sections of the health bar to deplete, putting Thor down won’t be an easy task, especially without the help of Kratos’ Leviathan Axe – at least to begin with. However, with consistent and strategic attacks, and well-timed dodges, you’ll be able to slowly but effectively pick away at Thor’s health.\n",
      "Now, despite Thor’s size, he’s especially quick and, unsurprisingly, very powerful, so much so that he’ll barrel through all the stone pillars in the area with ease, essentially leaving no area safe from his relentless attacks.\n",
      "In case you need a reminder, here’s a breakdown of what each of the different colored attacks mean:\n",
      "Yellow rings indicate that the attack is blockable but has block breaks that can leave Kratos vulnerable to damage. To avoid taking damage, you’ll need to ensure you’re quickly parrying each of the incoming attacks, otherwise, you’ll be vulnerable to damage. Parrying these attacks won’t be easy, so it’s important to remain focused throughout the battle with Thor. Red rings indicate that the attack cannot be blocked, and will deal damage through the guard, so it’s essential to your survival that you dodge and avoid these attacks at all costs.\n",
      "Thor Phase 1\n",
      "Starting the fight, Thor will begin charging toward you, so to combat this, enable Spartan Rage from the get-go. With successful hits, this unleashed fury should automatically take Thor down almost a complete bar of health.\n",
      "Higher Difficulty Tip : Try to save Spartan Rage for when you’re low on health, especially if you’re having trouble getting down the attack patterns. Doing so will allow you to do what damage you can while taking hits, then recover some of that health back while dealing even more damage to Thor. If you die, there’s a good chance you’ll come back with your Spartan Rage meter closer to being full (at least on your first death). Try to make the most of this opportunity.\n",
      "Once the Rage has ended, it’s time to calm down and take things slowly as you carefully dodge and parry as many of Thor’s incoming attacks as possible.\n",

      "\n",
      "One of Thor’s most dangerous attacks comes in the form of an unblockable charge, which, when caught, will see Thor picking up Kratos and slamming him into the ground. With no way to parry this attack, your best option will be to look out for the red circles that indicate the incoming attack and prepare to dodge it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another one of Thor’s attacks will see him quickly raising his hands to his stomach and then unleashing a burst of energy in your direction. While it can be blocked with Kratos’ shield, the attack is relatively quick and easily missed if you don’t raise your shield fast enough. If you’re far enough away, you can look out for Thor’s windup and dodge the move.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thor will also launch a three-punch combination, followed by a spartan kick, which, when caught, will send Kratos flying backward. Thankfully, these attacks can be blocked, but like Bjorn, they will feature block breaks, leaving Kratos vulnerable to damage, so timing your parries carefully on this attack will be crucial to your success.\n",
      "If you’re starting to run low on health, have Kratos break through the stone pillars in the area in hopes of receiving some Healthstones. Thor can cause pretty significant damage, so you’ll want to remain as high health as possible if you’re looking to make it out of the fight. If Thor is nearby when you pick up the health, the force of adding new life force will lightly stagger Thor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you’ve knocked off two blocks of Thor’s health, you’ll be prompted to press R3 to deliver a significant blow. Following a short cutscene, Kratos can recall his Leviathan Axe by pressing Triangle and then will send it crashing into Thor’s chest.\n",
      "Thor Phase 2\n",
      "Now that we’ve got ourselves a fight, Thor will proceed to showcase a new attack that sees him raising his hands above his head and then slamming them into the ground, creating an AoE shockwave. To avoid this damage, you’ll want to ensure you’re always standing at a distance when this attack is performed.\n",
      "Furthermore, if timed just right, you’ll be able to cancel out Thor’s incoming attacks by simply launching a light or heavy attack upon him before he can start his attack.\n",
      "While there are several ways to approach this fight, our best success came when launching attacks upon Thor as he walked toward Kratos. If timed just right, you’ll have the chance to charge at him, canceling out his incoming combination attack, which will briefly stun him for a quick moment.\n",
      "Higher Difficulty Tip : If you’re playing more cautiously, be sure to take every opportunity to charge up the frost power of the Leviathan Axe by holding triangle. You can do this most frequently in every phase of this fight while Thor is raising his fist for the shockwave.\n",
      "To finish off the battle, continue to unleash smart and effective attacks at Thor, and upon depleting his health bar, you’ll be prompted to press R3 to deliver the final blow – or so you thought. After a short cutscene, Thor will move the battle outside to the frozen lake.\n",
      "Thor Phase 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Having replenished his health bar, you’ll need to deplete all six sections of Thor’s health once again. However, offering much of the same in terms of Thor’s attacks and movement, he does happen to introduce a few new attacks to his arsenal.\n",
      "\n",
      "These include a hammer toss, which he will throw quickly in your direction and is unblockable (you’ll need to dodge this attack instead); a three-punch combination with his hammer, which can be blocked and parried if timed correctly; and lastly, an electrified shockwave that will see him swiping his hammer along the ground, sending a shockwave traveling in your direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "While our recommended attack strategy above still applies here, you’ll also find a few pillars around the area that can be picked up, and tossed at Thor to deplete at least half of his current health bar section.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dealing enough damage, a short cutscene will begin, and Thor will grab ahold of Kratos. Here you’ll need to mash circle on two different occasions in order to save Kratos from succumbing to Thor’s power.\n",

      "Continue unleashing even more damage upon Thor until you’re prompted again to press R3. After another short cutscene, Thor and Kratos will continue to battle it out, refusing to give up. Moving to another location for the third and final time, it’s time to take Thor down for good.\n",
      "Thor Phase 4\n",
      "With a newly replenished health bar, you’ll need to continue picking away at Thor’s health while also being careful to dodge Thor’s newly introduced attacks for the fourth phase of the battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "These new attacks include a lightning attack that will occur when Thor slams his hammer into the ground, launching lightning strikes around the area. Again, you’ll need to be quick to dodge these strikes, in which the strike zones are marked as red on the ground; otherwise, you’ll be dealt damage and will need to mash Circle to escape its electrical pull.\n",
      "Higher Difficulty Tip : While Thor is throwing down lightning, get behind him and deal a heavy blow. Use this break as an opportunity to get in as much damage as possible.\n",
      "By now, you’ll likely have built up enough Rage to unleash Kratos’ Spartan Rage. You this to deplete a rather large chunk from Thor’s health. After depleting at least two and a half health bars, a cutscene will begin, and you’ll be prompted to press R1 to use your Leviathan Axe to destroy the stone pillar above Thor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsuccessful in catching Thor off guard, continue the picking away at Thor’s health until his health bar is almost fully depleted. Once enough damage has been dealt, you’ll enter one final cutscene that sees Kratos showing his true self, the God of War. Pleased with this showing, Thor will consider Kratos’ blood debt paid and will flee the area.\n",

      "\n",
      "After traveling through the gate, Brok offers to organize housing for Kratos and Atreus while their stave is broken to help ensure Odin and Thor aren’t spying on their every move. After the short conversation, continue through the second gate to return home to Atreus.\n",

      "\n",
      "One of Thor’s most dangerous attacks comes in the form of an unblockable charge, which, when caught, will see Thor picking up Kratos and slamming him into the ground. With no way to parry this attack, your best option will be to look out for the red circles that indicate the incoming attack and prepare to dodge it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another one of Thor’s attacks will see him quickly raising his hands to his stomach and then unleashing a burst of energy in your direction. While it can be blocked with Kratos’ shield, the attack is relatively quick and easily missed if you don’t raise your shield fast enough. If you’re far enough away, you can look out for Thor’s windup and dodge the move.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thor will also launch a three-punch combination, followed by a spartan kick, which, when caught, will send Kratos flying backward. Thankfully, these attacks can be blocked, but like Bjorn, they will feature block breaks, leaving Kratos vulnerable to damage, so timing your parries carefully on this attack will be crucial to your success.\n",
      "If you’re starting to run low on health, have Kratos break through the stone pillars in the area in hopes of receiving some Healthstones. Thor can cause pretty significant damage, so you’ll want to remain as high health as possible if you’re looking to make it out of the fight. If Thor is nearby when you pick up the health, the force of adding new life force will lightly stagger Thor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you’ve knocked off two blocks of Thor’s health, you’ll be prompted to press R3 to deliver a significant blow. Following a short cutscene, Kratos can recall his Leviathan Axe by pressing Triangle and then will send it crashing into Thor’s chest.\n",
      "Thor Phase 2\n",
      "Now that we’ve got ourselves a fight, Thor will proceed to showcase a new attack that sees him raising his hands above his head and then slamming them into the ground, creating an AoE shockwave. To avoid this damage, you’ll want to ensure you’re always standing at a distance when this attack is performed.\n",
      "Furthermore, if timed just right, you’ll be able to cancel out Thor’s incoming attacks by simply launching a light or heavy attack upon him before he can start his attack.\n",
      "While there are several ways to approach this fight, our best success came when launching attacks upon Thor as he walked toward Kratos. If timed just right, you’ll have the chance to charge at him, canceling out his incoming combination attack, which will briefly stun him for a quick moment.\n",
      "Higher Difficulty Tip : If you’re playing more cautiously, be sure to take every opportunity to charge up the frost power of the Leviathan Axe by holding triangle. You can do this most frequently in every phase of this fight while Thor is raising his fist for the shockwave.\n",
      "To finish off the battle, continue to unleash smart and effective attacks at Thor, and upon depleting his health bar, you’ll be prompted to press R3 to deliver the final blow – or so you thought. After a short cutscene, Thor will move the battle outside to the frozen lake.\n",
      "Thor Phase 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Having replenished his health bar, you’ll need to deplete all six sections of Thor’s health once again. However, offering much of the same in terms of Thor’s attacks and movement, he does happen to introduce a few new attacks to his arsenal.\n",
      "\n",
      "These include a hammer toss, which he will throw quickly in your direction and is unblockable (you’ll need to dodge this attack instead); a three-punch combination with his hammer, which can be blocked and parried if timed correctly; and lastly, an electrified shockwave that will see him swiping his hammer along the ground, sending a shockwave traveling in your direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "While our recommended attack strategy above still applies here, you’ll also find a few pillars around the area that can be picked up, and tossed at Thor to deplete at least half of his current health bar section.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dealing enough damage, a short cutscene will begin, and Thor will grab ahold of Kratos. Here you’ll need to mash circle on two different occasions in order to save Kratos from succumbing to Thor’s power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the second time around, Kratos will fall Thor’s power; however, not done with him yet, Thor will proceed to shock him back to life, refusing to end the battle until Thor has seen the real Kratos. This scene is staged regardless of your proficiency in this fight.\n",
      "Continue unleashing even more damage upon Thor until you’re prompted again to press R3. After another short cutscene, Thor and Kratos will continue to battle it out, refusing to give up. Moving to another location for the third and final time, it’s time to take Thor down for good.\n",
      "Thor Phase 4\n",
      "With a newly replenished health bar, you’ll need to continue picking away at Thor’s health while also being careful to dodge Thor’s newly introduced attacks for the fourth phase of the battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "These new attacks include a lightning attack that will occur when Thor slams his hammer into the ground, launching lightning strikes around the area. Again, you’ll need to be quick to dodge these strikes, in which the strike zones are marked as red on the ground; otherwise, you’ll be dealt damage and will need to mash Circle to escape its electrical pull.\n",
      "Higher Difficulty Tip : While Thor is throwing down lightning, get behind him and deal a heavy blow. Use this break as an opportunity to get in as much damage as possible.\n",
      "By now, you’ll likely have built up enough Rage to unleash Kratos’ Spartan Rage. You this to deplete a rather large chunk from Thor’s health. After depleting at least two and a half health bars, a cutscene will begin, and you’ll be prompted to press R1 to use your Leviathan Axe to destroy the stone pillar above Thor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsuccessful in catching Thor off guard, continue the picking away at Thor’s health until his health bar is almost fully depleted. Once enough damage has been dealt, you’ll enter one final cutscene that sees Kratos showing his true self, the God of War. Pleased with this showing, Thor will consider Kratos’ blood debt paid and will flee the area.\n",

      "Much like a normal Raider, the Raider Chief uses standard melee attacks, including Axe slams and Axe swings. So, whether you use your Axe or Blades of Chaos, your best option to defeat the Raider Chief will be to keep at a distance during their attacks and only go in for close-range combat between their attacks.\n",

      "Urging the wolves to continue, despite the danger ahead, Freya transforms into a falcon before soon returning to her human form as she launches an attack on Kratos. Fending off her attack by pressing the button prompt (L1), the father and son will continue their escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having regained control of Kratos, steer the sled and avoid all obstacles that block your track – don’t fear if you do happen to run into any, as the wolves will jump over the rubble, and your sled will break through. After dodging your first two obstacles, Freya will launch another attack on Kratos, and you’ll be prompted to button mash circle to fend her off.\n",
      "After successfully fending her off for a second time, Freya will continue her pursuit, causing plenty of damage in her path as she pulls out all stops in an attempt to stop Kratos and Atreus from escaping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming around for a third attempt, Freya will knock Atreus out of the sled and will grab ahold of Kratos. To fend off her attacks, you’ll need to press L1, R1, L1, and L1 to succeed in fending her off. Then, after helping Atreus back into the sled, Freya will attempt one final attack as she launches herself at Kratos, driving a sword into his shoulder – you’ll need to mash circle to survive.\n",

      "When nearing the house, a cutscene will begin that sees Atreus comforting his dying wolf, Fenrir, before he passes. Following Fenrir’s death, Kratos insists on training – despite the circumstances. But, as you would suspect, Atreus doesn’t take well to the comment and will refuse, instead heading off into the woods to bury his friend.\n",

      "Track Atreus\n",
      "Awakening from the dream, Mimir will inform Kratos that Atreus has yet to return from burying the wolf. Then, with his worry growing, leave the house and begin tracking Atreus' footprints, which lead down the lantern-lit path we recently used to reach the house – Mimir assumes Atreus will likely have done the burying by the frozen river.\n",

      "When reaching the fork in the path, head left and continue past Speki and Svanna’s den as you head towards a small opening in the rock wall, beside some glyphs. To break through the ice blocking the path forward, perform a heavy attack (R2) with Kratos’ Leviathan Axe.\n",
      "Once inside, continue through the small cave, vaulting over the nearby obstacle. Upon reaching the woods outside the cave, continue following Atreus’ footprints until you reach a small clearing, which will see a small cutscene as Kratos investigates the sudden disappearance of the tracks.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the short investigation, Kratos is ambushed by a group of seven Raiders as they charge toward him. To disperse the enemies, you’ll want to use a combination of both light and heavy attacks (R1 and R2, respectively), all while incorporating long-distance attacks with the help of Kratos’ Leviathan Axe, which can stun enemies temporarily.\n",
      "Right off the bat, Kratos’ Leviathan Axe will have access to several skill abilities to use, which include: Technique Skills: Frost Awaken I - Hold Triangle to imbue the Leviathan Axe with ice and power up the next Melee or Ranged Attack with high frost. Frozen Breach - Press R1 during Frost Awaken to do a wide swing and apply Frost to nearby enemies. Frozen Spike - Aim and Press R1 during Frost Awaken to quickly throw the Leviathan Axe and create a Frost explosion on impact. Ranged Skills: Axe Throw - Aim and Press R1 to quickly throw the Leviathan Axe forward. Can cause a more severe reaction when striking an enemy in the head or legs. Freezing Throw I - Aim and Press R2 to throw the Leviathan Axe forward with force. Can freeze weaker enemies for a short duration. Melee Skills: Frost Rush - While sprinting, Press R1 to perform a leaping slash. Leviathan’s Fury - While sprinting, Press R2 to perform a massive leaping attack applying Frost.\n",
      "While attacking the enemies, remember to dodge their incoming attacks – hitting an enemy with your Leviathan Axe while an enemy is launching an attack will cancel their attack and temporarily stun them.\n",
      "Furthermore, enemy attacks are indicated by the color of the small triangle shape that appears at the bottom of the screen when engaged in combat.\n",
      "White indicates an enemy is targeting you. Yellow indicates an incoming attack. Red indicates an incoming, unblockable attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the Raiders have been dealt with, it’s time to check on the stave by passing under the fallen tree (marked with glyphs) blocking the path to your left. Before continuing forward, be sure to pick up the glowing green Healthstone to restore Kratos’ health.\n",
      "Learning that the stave has broken, allowing enemies to trespass into the area, continue a few meters forward and inspect the fallen bear. With signs pointing to the bear being a victim of a larger bear’s attack, continue following the tracks left in the snow forward as you head deeper into the woods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Needing to find a way around the blocked path, continue a short distance to the right of the blockage to discover a fallen tree. Then, clear the path by throwing your Leviathan Axe at the partially broken tree trunk to jump across the gap (circle).\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you’re back on the trail, continue following the bloodied path until you reach some ledges you’ll need to climb. To your right, you’ll find a frozen enemy that you can loot for some Hacksilver (a currency used to purchase weapons, armor, and upgrades).\n"

These projectiles will span several meters, so you’ll want to avoid dodging side to side and, instead, dodge backward to better escape this attack.\n",

      "\n",
      "This should put you on the right side of the chest’s platform, toward a corner with vases you can destroy for Hacksilver. The prompt to climb up should appear already. Use it to get up to the chest and claim your Hacksilver reward. Now, return to Atreus.\n",
      "Before you can reach the shrine, you’ll need to clear the pillar that’s blocking the path – latch onto the pillar with your blades and move it out of the way as prompted.\n",

      "Unable to move the pillar, use your Axe to hit the weakspot (the shining silver spot that looks like it’s had a bite taken out of it) of the log to the right of the staircase that’s preventing you from moving the pillar. With that out of the way, you can move the pillar.\n",

      "Now that you’re ready to return home to make preparations for the journey to Svartalfheim in search of Tyr, return to the shrine and follow Atreus as he jumps down the nearby ledge. Before continuing, look to your right, and you’ll discover a red chest hidden behind a large gate.\n",

      "Much like a normal Raider, the Raider Chief uses standard melee attacks, including Axe slams and Axe swings. So, whether you use your Axe or Blades of Chaos, your best option to defeat the Raider Chief will be to keep at a distance during their attacks and only go in for close-range combat between their attacks.\n",

      "If you find yourself defeated a few times in a row, use those fights as a learning moment on how to better parry or dodge attacks. The more parries the better, though.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of Thor’s most dangerous attacks comes in the form of an unblockable charge, which, when caught, will see Thor picking up Kratos and slamming him into the ground. With no way to parry this attack, your best option will be to look out for the red circles that indicate the incoming attack and prepare to dodge it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another one of Thor’s attacks will see him quickly raising his hands to his stomach and then unleashing a burst of energy in your direction. While it can be blocked with Kratos’ shield, the attack is relatively quick and easily missed if you don’t raise your shield fast enough. If you’re far enough away, you can look out for Thor’s windup and dodge the move.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thor will also launch a three-punch combination, followed by a spartan kick, which, when caught, will send Kratos flying backward. Thankfully, these attacks can be blocked, but like Bjorn, they will feature block breaks, leaving Kratos vulnerable to damage, so timing your parries carefully on this attack will be crucial to your success.\n",
      "If you’re starting to run low on health, have Kratos break through the stone pillars in the area in hopes of receiving some Healthstones. Thor can cause pretty significant damage, so you’ll want to remain as high health as possible if you’re looking to make it out of the fight. If Thor is nearby when you pick up the health, the force of adding new life force will lightly stagger Thor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you’ve knocked off two blocks of Thor’s health, you’ll be prompted to press R3 to deliver a significant blow. Following a short cutscene, Kratos can recall his Leviathan Axe by pressing Triangle and then will send it crashing into Thor’s chest.\n",
      "Thor Phase 2\n",
      "Now that we’ve got ourselves a fight, Thor will proceed to showcase a new attack that sees him raising his hands above his head and then slamming them into the ground, creating an AoE shockwave. To avoid this damage, you’ll want to ensure you’re always standing at a distance when this attack is performed.\n",
      "Furthermore, if timed just right, you’ll be able to cancel out Thor’s incoming attacks by simply launching a light or heavy attack upon him before he can start his attack.\n",
      "While there are several ways to approach this fight, our best success came when launching attacks upon Thor as he walked toward Kratos. If timed just right, you’ll have the chance to charge at him, canceling out his incoming combination attack, which will briefly stun him for a quick moment.\n",
      "Higher Difficulty Tip : If you’re playing more cautiously, be sure to take every opportunity to charge up the frost power of the Leviathan Axe by holding triangle. You can do this most frequently in every phase of this fight while Thor is raising his fist for the shockwave.\n",
      "To finish off the battle, continue to unleash smart and effective attacks at Thor, and upon depleting his health bar, you’ll be prompted to press R3 to deliver the final blow – or so you thought. After a short cutscene, Thor will move the battle outside to the frozen lake.\n",
      "Thor Phase 3\n",
      "\n",
      "Having replenished his health bar, you’ll need to deplete all six sections of Thor’s health once again. However, offering much of the same in terms of Thor’s attacks and movement, he does happen to introduce a few new attacks to his arsenal.\n",
      "\n",
      "These include a hammer toss, which he will throw quickly in your direction and is unblockable (you’ll need to dodge this attack instead); a three-punch combination with his hammer, which can be blocked and parried if timed correctly; and lastly, an electrified shockwave that will see him swiping his hammer along the ground, sending a shockwave traveling in your direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "While our recommended attack strategy above still applies here, you’ll also find a few pillars around the area that can be picked up, and tossed at Thor to deplete at least half of his current health bar section.\n",
      "\n",
      "After dealing enough damage, a short cutscene will begin, and Thor will grab ahold of Kratos. Here you’ll need to mash circle on two different occasions in order to save Kratos from succumbing to Thor’s power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, the second time around, Kratos will fall Thor’s power; however, not done with him yet, Thor will proceed to shock him back to life, refusing to end the battle until Thor has seen the real Kratos. This scene is staged regardless of your proficiency in this fight.\n",
      "Continue unleashing even more damage upon Thor until you’re prompted again to press R3. After another short cutscene, Thor and Kratos will continue to battle it out, refusing to give up. Moving to another location for the third and final time, it’s time to take Thor down for good.\n",
      "Thor Phase 4\n",
      "With a newly replenished health bar, you’ll need to continue picking away at Thor’s health while also being careful to dodge Thor’s newly introduced attacks for the fourth phase of the battle.\n",
      "\n",
      "These new attacks include a lightning attack that will occur when Thor slams his hammer into the ground, launching lightning strikes around the area. Again, you’ll need to be quick to dodge these strikes, in which the strike zones are marked as red on the ground; otherwise, you’ll be dealt damage and will need to mash Circle to escape its electrical pull.\n",
      "Higher Difficulty Tip : While Thor is throwing down lightning, get behind him and deal a heavy blow. Use this break as an opportunity to get in as much damage as possible.\n",
      "By now, you’ll likely have built up enough Rage to unleash Kratos’ Spartan Rage. You this to deplete a rather large chunk from Thor’s health. After depleting at least two and a half health bars, a cutscene will begin, and you’ll be prompted to press R1 to use your Leviathan Axe to destroy the stone pillar above Thor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsuccessful in catching Thor off guard, continue the picking away at Thor’s health until his health bar is almost fully depleted. Once enough damage has been dealt, you’ll enter one final cutscene that sees Kratos showing his true self, the God of War. Pleased with this showing, Thor will consider Kratos’ blood debt paid and will flee the area.\n",
      "Return Home to Atreus\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as Thor flees, Sindri and Brok will break through the nearby ice wall, offering their assistance. Worried about Atreus’ under Odin’s watch, follow Sindri and Brok through the tunnel and up to the top of the bridge and into their workshop, as they agree to help prepare a gate for Kratos to travel through to ensure he reaches Atreus before it’s too late.\n",
      "\n",
      "After traveling through the gate, Brok offers to organize housing for Kratos and Atreus while their stave is broken to help ensure Odin and Thor aren’t spying on their every move. After the short conversation, continue through the second gate to return home to Atreus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following a lengthy cutscene that sees Atreus attempting to regain Kratos’ trust after failing to mention his search for Tyr, Kratos instructs Atreus to pack his things as they prepare to head out in search of a way to keep the troublesome gods away.\n",
      "Follow Arteus through the Forest\n",

      "\n",
      "Then, having equipped all the necessary armor and upgrades, continue outside the house and follow Atreus as he leads you to the old temple in the Wild Woods.\n",
      "Along the way, you’ll encounter several fresh bodies of Raiders that have been attacked. With no clues left behind, it’s safe to assume we’re not the only ones out here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following Atreus further into the forest, you’ll soon come by some Brambles blocking the path forward. Press left on the d-pad to change to the Blades of Chaos and ignite the Brambles by pressing L2 + R2.\n",
      "\n",
      "Learning that the bridge has collapsed, follow Atreus down the path just right of the bridge and use your blades to pull down the wooden board blocking the ledge above – you can latch on the wooden board by pressing circle when nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "After climbing the ledge, you’ll find Raider, now turned Hel-Raider, hanging from a tree. If you wish, you can pull down the Hel-Raider by using your Blades of Chaos – remember that to calm them down, you’ll want to attack them with fire.

Focus on their weak points: Enhanced Grims have a weak spot on their back that deals more damage when hit. Try to aim for this area whenever possible.\\n\\n2. Use ranged attacks: The Leviathan Axe's Ranged Skills, such as Freezing Throw I and Axe Throw, can help you take out Enhanced Grims from a distance before they get too close. This will give you more time to dodge their attacks.\\n\\n3. Parry their attacks: Just like with regular Grims, you can parry Enhanced Grims' attacks by timing your shield block at the right moment. This not only avoids damage but also stuns them briefly, giving you a chance to attack.\\n\\n4. Use Mjolnir: If you have the Mjolnir hammer from the previous game, it can be very effective against Enhanced Grims. The hammer's charged attacks deal massive damage and can also stun enemies temporarily.\\n\\n5. Upgrade your gear: Make sure to upgrade Kratos' weapons and armor with Hacksilver and resources found throughout the game. This will increase their stats, making it easier to take down Enhanced Grims.\\n\\nRemember, Enhanced Grims are tougher enemies but can still be defeated with a bit of strategy and patience.
