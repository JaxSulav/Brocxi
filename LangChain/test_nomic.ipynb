And while it’s arguably easier to just dodge this attack, it’s also possible to block it with your shield, or even parry it back into the creature if you’re using the Dauntless Shield, dealing damage and temporarily stunning it.\n",
      "Keep in mind, though, to parry the attack, you will need to be very precise with your timing, as it’ll only work if you block the attack just before it hits you. Once the Dreki is stunned, we recommend rushing the creature and unleashing as much heavy damage as possible before the stun effect runs out. This includes using your Runic Attack. Using the Runic Attack early in a fight is generally recommended so you can get the cooldown timer going as soon as possible.\n",
      "Fortunately, the Dreki does not have any unblockable attacks until it reaches half health, so technically speaking, every attack the Dreki throws your way can be blocked; however, this isn’t necessarily very efficient as it makes it quite a bit more challenging to deal damage.\n",

The first melee attack will see the Dreki jumping toward you, and landing several meters in front of you. The Dreki will then quickly turn and swipe its large tail in your direction - you can either block this attack with your shield or simply dodge out of the way.\n",

Successfully countering the attack with a parry from the Dauntless Shield will see you tossing the ball of salvia back.\n",

If you’re within the electrical circle after it finishes charging, you’ll be dealt damage and temporarily stunned, unable to move or block incoming attacks.\n",

The Dreki's initial saliva attack can be blocked with your shield or parried back into the creature if using the Dauntless Shield, but its melee attacks should still be avoided or blocked. Once it reaches half health, the Dreki will have unblockable attacks, making every attack potentially dangerous to block. To deal significant damage, rush the creature and unleash heavy attacks during its stun effect, including using your Runic Attack early in the fight. Remember to conserve your health by looking for resources beside crates in the area. With these strategies, you can defeat Dreki, earning a Chaos Flame, +4 Dragon Tooths, and a Light Runic Attack (Flames of Anguish) as rewards.\n"
