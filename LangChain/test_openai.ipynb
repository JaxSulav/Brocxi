Here you should spot a pillar holding up the water trough with gold segments: use the Blades of Chaos to turn the end of the trough, which will cause a giant crate holding a stone block to move towards you. While it’s doing this, use the explosive pot to your left to destroy the gold rocks, letting you leap up to the crane’s stone block one it’s in position. Once you’re on top of the stone block, throw the Leviathan Axe into the end of the trough: this blocks the water flow, making the crane move you to its original starting position. When the stone block has finally stopped moving, you can have Kratos hang off the side of the stone black and then leap over to a new area. From there, follow the mine cart tracks uphill: the Legendary Chest will be at the top on your right, not too far from the purple glowing artifact nearby. The chest contains the Pommels of the Undying Spark, which has +6 Strength, +3 Runic, and has Scorching Burn, which increases the damage the Burn status inflicts.\n",

      "Once the area is clear, head up the set of stairs, take the path left and climb up the nearby ledge marked with a glyph. When you reach the top, you’ll encounter three more Raiders, including a Raider Scout. After defeating the Raiders, continue up the next ledge, where you’ll find a Healthstone by the firepit.\n",

      "Defeat Bjorn\n",
      "As the bear sends you tumbling down to the ground below, you’ll need to mash circle to break free from its gripe. Now, Bjorn is by far the toughest enemy you’ll have faced thus far, and with a health bar broken down into five sections, you’ll need to unleash a lot of damage to take it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bjorn has two main attacks: a semi-blockable swipe attack that’s often combined with a charged entry and an unblockable ground slam that will deal damage through the guard. Now, it’s worth mentioning that when Bjorn performs his swipe attack, it’ll appear with yellow rings, indicating that the attack is blockable but has block breaks that can leave Kratos vulnerable to damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid this damage, you’ll need to ensure you’re parrying each of the three swipes; otherwise, you’ll be vulnerable to damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bjorn’s ground slam will appear with red rings, indicating that the attack cannot be blocked, and will deal damage through the guard, so it’s essential to your survival to dodge and avoid this attack at all costs. Keep in mind that this attack has a small AoE (area of effect) radius, so you’ll need to be well clear to avoid damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to its tough hide, throwing your Axe at Bjorn will have little effect, depleting only small amounts of health on each hit. For this reason, we recommend charging your Axe with Frost and then waiting for the bear to perform a slam – which can occur as part of its main slam attack if you’re standing within melee range after it performs a flurry of swipes, or after it charges at you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Bjorn returns to the ground, sprint over and unleash a flurry of heavy and light attacks, as there’s a small window of opportunity where the risk of being hit is very low, as the bear will attempt to regain its footing before launching another attack.\n",
      "After you’ve performed a handful of attacks, back up quickly to avoid taking damage from potential swipes, which have a relatively large radius. However, if you stay close for too long, the bear will bite into you and toss you backward after mashing Circle to escape.\n",
      "It is also worth noting that, like other enemies, Bjorn’s attacks can be canceled with a well-timed Axe throw or melee attack. Furthermore, if you’re starting to run low on health, have Kratos break through the small trees that litter the area in hopes of receiving some Healthstones.\n"

Here you should spot a pillar holding up the water trough with gold segments: use the Blades of Chaos to turn the end of the trough, which will cause a giant crate holding a stone block to move towards you. While it’s doing this, use the explosive pot to your left to destroy the gold rocks, letting you leap up to the crane’s stone block one it’s in position. Once you’re on top of the stone block, throw the Leviathan Axe into the end of the trough: this blocks the water flow, making the crane move you to its original starting position. When the stone block has finally stopped moving, you can have Kratos hang off the side of the stone black and then leap over to a new area. From there, follow the mine cart tracks uphill: the Legendary Chest will be at the top on your right, not too far from the purple glowing artifact nearby. The chest contains the Pommels of the Undying Spark, which has +6 Strength, +3 Runic, and has Scorching Burn, which increases the damage the Burn status inflicts.\n",

Now, Bjorn is by far the toughest enemy you’ll have faced thus far, and with a health bar broken down into five sections, you’ll need to unleash a lot of damage to take it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bjorn has two main attacks: a semi-blockable swipe attack that’s often combined with a charged entry and an unblockable ground slam that will deal damage through the guard. Now, it’s worth mentioning that when Bjorn performs his swipe attack, it’ll appear with yellow rings, indicating that the attack is blockable but has block breaks that can leave Kratos vulnerable to damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "To avoid this damage, you’ll need to ensure you’re parrying each of the three swipes; otherwise, you’ll be vulnerable to damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bjorn’s ground slam will appear with red rings, indicating that the attack cannot be blocked, and will deal damage through the guard, so it’s essential to your survival to dodge and avoid this attack at all costs. Keep in mind that this attack has a small AoE (area of effect) radius, so you’ll need to be well clear to avoid damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to its tough hide, throwing your Axe at Bjorn will have little effect, depleting only small amounts of health on each hit. For this reason, we recommend charging your Axe with Frost and then waiting for the bear to perform a slam – which can occur as part of its main slam attack if you’re standing within melee range after it performs a flurry of swipes, or after it charges at you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once Bjorn returns to the ground, sprint over and unleash a flurry of heavy and light attacks, as there’s a small window of opportunity where the risk of being hit is very low, as the bear will attempt to regain its footing before launching another attack.\n",
      "After you’ve performed a handful of attacks, back up quickly to avoid taking damage from potential swipes, which have a relatively large radius. However, if you stay close for too long, the bear will bite into you and toss you backward after mashing Circle to escape.\n",
      "It is also worth noting that, like other enemies, Bjorn’s attacks can be canceled with a well-timed Axe throw or melee attack. Furthermore, if you’re starting to run low on health, have Kratos break through the small trees that litter the area in hopes of receiving some Healthstones.\n"

Use the Blades of Chaos to stun them: One effective way to take down Enhanced Grims is by stunning them with your Blades of Chaos. When they're stunned, you can deal heavy damage without having to worry about their poisonous saliva.\\n\\n2. Keep moving: Enhanced Grims have a wide range attack, so it's essential to keep moving and avoid getting cornered. This will also prevent them from being able to spit at you continuously.\\n\\n3. Use ranged attacks: The Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos both have ranged attacks that can be used to take down Enhanced Grims from a distance. This is especially useful if there are multiple grims in the area, as it allows you to thin out their numbers before engaging them in melee combat.\\n\\n4. Use elemental weapons: Elemental weapons like the Frozen Axe and the Blaze of Set can be effective against Enhanced Grims. The Frozen Axe can freeze the grims, making them vulnerable to attack, while the Blaze of Set can burn them, reducing their health quickly.\\n\\n5. Use cover: Enhanced Grims can deal heavy damage, so it's essential to use cover to avoid getting hit. This will also prevent them from being able to spit at you continuously.\\n\\n6. Take out the Cursed Grims first: If there are both regular and Enhanced Grims in an area, take out the regular ones first. This will prevent the Enhanced Grims from being able to spit at you continuously, making them easier to deal with.\\n\\nRemember, patience is key when dealing with Enhanced Grims. Take your time, use your surroundings to your advantage, and don't be afraid to retreat if things get too overwhelming. With these tips in mind, you should be able to take down even the toughest of foes.\"}"
